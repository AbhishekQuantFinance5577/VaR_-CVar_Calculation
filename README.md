# VaR_CVar_Calculation
Calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for Portfolio Risk Management


Project Title: Risk Analysis of Stocks and Cryptocurrencies Using VaR and CVaR
Project Description
This project aims to analyze the risk and return characteristics of selected stocks and cryptocurrencies by calculating their Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) at various confidence levels. The analysis helps in understanding the risk exposure of these assets and provides insights for cross-asset investment decisions.

Problem A1: Descriptive Statistics of Returns
Data Collection:

Downloaded daily prices for two stocks and two cryptocurrencies from Yahoo Finance, ensuring at least 252 observations for each asset.
Simple Returns Calculation:

Calculated the daily simple returns for each asset.
Descriptive Statistics:

Computed the mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis for the returns of each asset.
Analysis:

Interpreted the descriptive statistics using investment logic and cross-asset investment analysis.
Key Findings:

Mean Returns: Indicate the average daily returns for each asset.
Variance and Standard Deviation: Measure the dispersion and volatility of returns.
Skewness: Provides insights into the asymmetry of the return distribution.
Kurtosis: Indicates the presence of outliers and the peakedness of the return distribution.
Investment Logic and Cross-Asset Analysis:

Compared the risk and return profiles of stocks versus cryptocurrencies.
Discussed implications for portfolio diversification and risk management.
Problem A2: Value-at-Risk (VaR) Calculation
Methodology:

Calculated VaR for each asset at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels using the historical simulation method.
Analysis:

Interpreted the change in risk exposure with increasing confidence levels.
Key Findings:

VaR at Different Confidence Levels: Showed the maximum potential loss for each asset within the specified confidence intervals.
Risk Exposure Analysis: Highlighted how risk varies between stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Investment Logic and Cross-Asset Analysis:

Discussed the implications of VaR for risk management.
Compared risk profiles across different asset classes.
Problem A3: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Calculation
Methodology:

Calculated CVaR (or Expected Shortfall) for each asset at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels using the historical simulation method.
Analysis:

Interpreted the change in risk exposure with increasing confidence levels.
Key Findings:

CVaR at Different Confidence Levels: Showed the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold for each asset.
Comparison with VaR: Provided deeper insights into tail risk and extreme losses.
Investment Logic and Cross-Asset Analysis:

Discussed the advantages of CVaR over VaR in risk management.
Compared and contrasted the risk profiles of stocks and cryptocurrencies using both VaR and CVaR.
Overall Insights:

Provided comprehensive risk assessments for stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Highlighted the differences in risk exposure and tail risk between the two asset classes.
Offered recommendations for portfolio optimization and risk mitigation based on the findings.
